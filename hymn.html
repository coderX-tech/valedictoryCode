        I'm pressing on the upward way, <br>
        New heights I'm gaining every day; <br>
        Still praying as I'm onward bound, <br>
        Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. <br>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div class="chorus">
        Lord, lift me up and let me stand,<br>
        By faith on Heaven's tableland,<br>
        A higher plane than I have found,<br>
        Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.  <br> 
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        My heart has no desire to stay<br>
        Where doubts arise and fears dismay;<br>
        Though some may dwell where these abound,<br>
        My prayer, my aim is higher ground. <br>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        I want to live above the world,<br>
        Though Satan's darts at me are hurled,<br>
        For faith has caught the joyful sound,<br>
        The song of saints on higher ground, <br>
